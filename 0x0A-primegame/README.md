# 0x0A. Prime Game

## Description
This project involves leveraging your understanding of prime numbers, game theory, and algorithm optimization to solve a competitive game scenario. The challenge is to determine the winner of a game based on the strategic removal of prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers.

## Concepts Covered
- **Prime Numbers**: Understanding and identifying prime numbers within a range.
- **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: An efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit.
- **Game Theory**: Principles of competitive games and optimal play strategies.
- **Dynamic Programming/Memoization**: Using previous results to optimize future calculations.
- **Python Programming**: Implementing game logic and algorithms using Python.

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should follow the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All files must be executable

## Files
- `prime_game.py`: Contains the implementation of the prime game algorithm.
- `test_prime_game.py`: Contains test cases to validate the functionality of the prime game algorithm.

## Usage
To run the prime game, execute the following command:
```bash
./prime_game.py
